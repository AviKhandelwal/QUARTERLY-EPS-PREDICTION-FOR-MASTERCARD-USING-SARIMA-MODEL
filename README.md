The objective of this project is to understand different components of Time series using the Mastercard EPS (Earnings per share) data of past 15 years and forecast the EPS values for next 2 years.

A seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model is a time series modeling technique comprising of 4 features which are-

1. Auto-Regressive: Takes the linear combination of past values of data to predict the next point in future.

2. Moving Average: Takes linear combination of past forecast errors to predict the next point in future.

3. Differencing: Transformation to make Time Series stationary.

4. Seasonality: Repeated cycle

The SARIMA model combines all the above characterstics to make a forecast about future values of Time series data points. It is one of the most practically used statistical approaches to deal with Time series data.
